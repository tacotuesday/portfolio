# Grafton Cook's Portfolio

Welcome to Grafton's portfolio repository! This repository contains a collection of Python notebooks and scripts to perform EDA and build machine learning models on various datasets related to my interests. My goal is to provide a comprehensive, easy-to-follow framework for data analysis and modeling that can be used by data scientists, researchers, and enthusiasts alike.

## Introduction

EDA is a critical step in any data analysis process, as it helps to understand the data, identify patterns, and reveal potential issues. The modeling stage, on the other hand, involves building machine learning models that can predict, classify, or cluster data points based on the patterns discovered during EDA.

This repository aims to show how I carry out these two critical steps in the data analysis process. I hope that users of this repository can quickly get started with their data analysis projects and leverage the power of machine learning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you can begin using this repository, please ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook (if you plan to use the notebooks)

### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tacotuesday/data_playground.git
```

Navigate to the repository's root directory and create a virtual environment:
```bash
cd data_playground
python3 -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
```PowerShell
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
- On macOS and Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required packages:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Add your dataset to the `data/` directory. I recommend creating a subdirectory for each dataset.
2. Create a Jupyter notebook or Python script in the `notebooks/` or `scripts/` directory, respectively. Use the existing templates as a starting point.
3. Perform EDA using the provided notebooks and scripts, making use of visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
4. Preprocess your data using the provided utilities and store the processed data in the `data/` directory.
5. Build, train, and evaluate machine learning models using popular libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Save the trained models in the `models/` directory.
6. Generate visualizations and summaries of your results, saving them in the `results/` directory.

## Contribution Guidelines

This repo is primarily for my own personal use. However, I welcome contributions to this repository, whether it's in the form of new datasets, EDA techniques, modeling methods, or improvements to the existing codebase. Please follow these guidelines when contributing:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
2. Ensure your code follows the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
3. Add comments and docstrings to your code to ensure clarity and maintainability.
4. If you add new dependencies, update the requirements.txt file accordingly.
5. Create a pull request and provide a detailed description of your changes. We will review your submission and provide feedback.
